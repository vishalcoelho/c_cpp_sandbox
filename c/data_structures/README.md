C/C++ Data Structures
---------------------

Data Structures written in C/C++. Some of the code in this folder are adaptations of [William Fiset's Data Structures Repository](https://github.com/williamfiset/DEPRECATED-data-structures) in C/C++.

You can find his [Video](https://youtu.be/RBSGKlAvoiM) describing these structures.
